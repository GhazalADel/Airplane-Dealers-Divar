## Swagger
start using swagger [echo-swagger man page](https://github.com/swaggo/echo-swagger)

The Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface to explore the API endpoints, view request/response details, and even test the API by sending requests directly from the Swagger UI.

Open a web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI URL. The default URL is typically http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html.
